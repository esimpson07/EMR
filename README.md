# EMR
An Electronic Medical Record program made for a mental health facility

This program will be able to securely store people's medical records, digitizing the previous forms of medical record storage at this facility. This will also implement all the functions of a medical practice app, such as:
 - Billing and revenue records: connected with the patient's insurance
 - Complete codes for billing, different appointment types and charging: virtual, office visits, evaluations, etc.
 - Prescription ordering for different conditions, as well as recurring orders and reminders when paperwork will be due
 - Video calling, messaging, group chats, connections in the app between different people
 - Activity and monitoring with all client / patient interactions, as well as meet up logs, no shows, etc. for patient and client safety
 - Filling out forms digitally so that all the information is stored online, as well as being backed up routinely.
 - Linking all the client data: in the current app, the client has no data stored with them, other than their name, email address, and phone number. This makes it so it is challenging to reference data and make connections where they may be necessary, including family history, previous conditions, and more. This will implement family tree linking among patients, as well as using the Holmes-Rahe stress scale to evaluate patient data statistics.
